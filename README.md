K-means
=======

Hybrid K-means clustering algorithm with OpenMP and MPI
K- Means clustering algorithm was implemented and compared in pure OpenMP, pure MPI and a hybrid version.In the hybrid implementation MPI was used to distribute the data load within nodes and OpenMP to parallelize the work inside the nodes.Various experiments were performed and showed the dominance of the hybrid implementation.
